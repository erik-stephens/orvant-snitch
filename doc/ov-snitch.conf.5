.TH ov-snitch.conf 5 2012-11-07 Linux "ov-snitch configuration file"
.SH NAME
ov-snitch.conf \- ov-snitch configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
With no configuration, ov-snitch will only log packet & program info to syslog.  Rules can be defined in a config file (\fB-c\fR) to deny packets based on destination address, destination port, and executable program name\&.
.sp
Rules map destinations, ports, and programs to more specific rules. When a packet is queued and processed by ov-snitch, the rules are traversed as far as possible.  A packet will be denied if the resulting rule contains deny:true\&.
.sp
.SH FORMAT
The entire file is interpreted as YAML.  Rules should be define at the top level under a \fIrules\fR key.
.SH EXAMPLE
rules:
    /usr/bin/curl:        # Deny all connections from the curl program
        1.2.3.4: {}       #   but make an exception for this host
        deny: true
    1.2.3.4:              # Deny all connections to this host
        deny: true
    1234:                 # Deny all connections for this port
        /bin/ssh:         #
            1.2.3.4: {}   #  but make an exception for this host when comes from ssh program
